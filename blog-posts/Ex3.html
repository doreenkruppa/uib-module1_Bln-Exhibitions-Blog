      “Queering the Crip, Cripping the Queer” is the first international exhibit
      exploring the multiple historical, cultural, and political intersections
      of queerness and disability. Disability studies scholar Carrie Sandahl,
      who coined the phrase, writes: “sexual minorities and people with
      disabilities. … share a history of injustice: both have been pathologized
      by medicine; demonized by religion; discriminated against in housing,
      employment, and education; stereotyped in representation; victimized by
      hate groups; and isolated socially, often in their families of origin.”

      Disability and queer histories are similar, if not always parallel.
      Sometimes queers and the disabled acquiesce to the fantasy of “the ideal
      body,” but queer/disabled artists mostly counter it. The exhibition is to
      a large degree curated by queers and people with disabilities; the
      contemporary artists exhibited largely self-identify as disabled and
      queer. Sandahl points out, “Those who claim both identities may be best
      positioned to illuminate their connections, to pinpoint where queerness
      and ‘cripdom’ intersect, separate and coincide.”

      The exhibit includes the work of 24 contemporary international artists
      whose works speak to the historical themes and objects of the exhibit, and
      includes a selection of work by artists who created while
      institutionalized and whose works were collected by the Prinzhorn
      Collection in Heidelberg, as well as a section on important queer/disabled
      artist icons Lorenza Böttner, Raimund Hoghe, and Audre Lorde.
