    <p>
      A difficult relationship with her father and a deep love for her mother
      inspired Louise Bourgeois’ great artistic output. In her sculptures and
      installations, such as the doused spiders and cages, so-called “Cells”,
      the artist, who died in 2010, expressed fear, sexuality, pain and
      security, from the core beyond the purely personal. In the show “The Woven
      Child” her late textile work comes into focus.
