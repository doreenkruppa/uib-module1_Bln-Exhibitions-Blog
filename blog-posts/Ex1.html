    <p>
      No one survives a real conversation is a joint exhibition by the artist
      Nicole Wendel and performer Kirstin Burckhardt, which deals with the
      nature of friendship. Using their own friendship as material, they have
      created artworks from their body-based practices. In addition to drawings
      and videos, visitors are invited to take part in performative encounters.
